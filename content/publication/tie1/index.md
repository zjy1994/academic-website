# (8) 摘要
abstract: Attenuation and phase shift data were collected under a frequency swept signal containing 801 frequencies from 2.00 to 10.00 GHz with a 10 MHz interval. To remove the inefficient frequencies, the optimized frequencies were selected by a two-stage frequency selection framework: 1) 17 frequency subsets were generated using the random forest-recursive feature elimination algorithm, and then 2) the optimal frequency set (including eight individual frequencies) was determined using voting strategies according to the results of ten-fold cross-validation.
