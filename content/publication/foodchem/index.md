# Abstract
abstract: In this study, three modified glassy carbon electrodes based on three-dimensional conducting polymer nanocomposites (TDCPNs) were fabricated for evaluating the aging process of *Huangjiu* (Chinese rice wines). The electrochemical activity and experimental conditions of the TDCPNs modified electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, the aging information obtained by the modified electrodes were optimized by variance inflation factor (VIF). Principal components analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE), and locality preserving projection (LPP, which presented the best classification result) based on the optimized data were applied to classify the wine samples. Then, the dimensionality reduction data of PCA, LLE, and LPP were used as input variables of the logistic regression and extreme learning machine (ELM) for evaluating the aging process of *Huangjiu*, and the LLE-ELM method exhibited the best prediction results. These results demonstrated that the TDCPNs modified electrodes presented the potential for the quality analysis of food and beverages.
