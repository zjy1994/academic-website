# (8) 摘要 Abstract
abstract: Inadequate drying and overdrying of grains due to the absence of timely and reliable information on moisture content (MC) aggravates grain postharvest loss. In this study, we investigate the real-time acquisition of MC using microwave free-space transmission measurements. A multi-frequency swept signal was used to acquire the attenuation and phase shift spectrum (2.00–10.00 GHz) of the paddy samples (9.553%–29.633% w.b.) for six thicknesses (1–6 cm). Based on the four rules that are followed in the phase-shift measurement, a phase-shift correction algorithm without any restrictions on the sample thickness was proposed to solve the phase-shift ambiguity that occurs when the sample thickness exceeds the wavelength. To choose the most effective frequencies, 17 candidate frequency subsets were generated by the recursive feature elimination algorithm, and the optimal frequency set, containing eight individual frequencies, was selected by using the Friedman and Nemenyi post-hoc tests. The sample thickness and microwave characteristics were used as the input variables to establish the prediction models to achieve a thickness-independent measurement of the MC, and the support vector machine model yielded the best performance (R2=0.992, RMSE=0.555%, MAE=0.398%). The results of this study should encourage future research on the real-time acquisition of reliable MC information in food processing and agriculture-related industries.
